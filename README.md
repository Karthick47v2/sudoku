Command-line based 9x9 sudoku generator and solver

run **run.bat** to compile and link cpp files

This algorithm generates standard 9x9 sudoku in <2ms and solves in <1ms.

>>To test the speed of algorithm, comment all codes below test() and run.

>>This program asks user to enter how many missing elements needs to be placed in each row/col and then generates sudoku. Then, it solves sudoku using backtracking algorithm, if the algorithm place a wrong number on missing cell, it will be indicated. User can decide to start over the solving process or remove the wrong number start the solving process from previous step.
